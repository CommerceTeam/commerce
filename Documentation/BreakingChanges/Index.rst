Changed modules
_______________
All modules are now using the core ModuleTemplate api.

FolderRepository::initFolders
 - now returns only the pid as integer of for the parameter given not the parents in an array.
 - does not create folders magicaly anymore. Please create it using FolderRepository::createFolder.
 - does not call the update utility anymore. Please call it on your own.
 - parameter $module and $pid changes position in method call. Fallback handling will be dropped in version 6

The basket is now a singleton object and not attached to the feuser object anymore. As long as you
use the api method \CommerceTeam\Commerce\Utility\GeneralUtility::getBasket() you dont need to change
your code.

Drop overwrite action from clickmenu. It does not make sense and only leads to strange side effects.
Drop DataHandlerUtility as it was only used for overwrite action.

In domain models the databaseClass is renamed into repositoryClass
In AbstractEntity getDatabaseConnection() got renamed into getRepository() to make match what it returns and a
new getDatabaseConnection() is put instead to return the TYPO3 databaseConnection.
